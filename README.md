# C++ SAT Solver Software System (OOP)

Developed a SAT solver using C++ to solve Boolean satisfiability problems. Implemented algorithms for clause learning, conflict analysis, and variable selection, resulting in a more efficient and effective solver.
System Components:
- Parser & Evaluator
- Tseitin Transformation
- DPLL Algorithm Solver
